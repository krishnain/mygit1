Virtualization
===================
This is the process of running multiple OS's parallelly on
a single pice of h/w.
Here we have h/w(bare metal) on top of which we have host os
and on the host os we install an application called as hypervisor
On the hypervisor we can run any no of OS's as guest OS

The disadvantage of this approach is these application running on the
guest OS have to pass through n number of lavers to access the H/W
resources.

Containarization
======================
Here we have bare metal on top of whcih we install the host Os
and on the hsot OS we install an application called as Docker Engine
On the docker engine we can run any application in the form of containers
Docker is a technology for creating thse containers

Docker achive what is commonly called as "process isolation"
ie all the applications(processes) have some dependency on a specific
OS.This dependency is removed by docker and we can run them on any
OS as containers if we have Docker engine installed

These containers pass through less no of layers to access the h/w resources
also organizations need not spend money on purchasing licenses of different
OS's to maintian various applications

Docker can be used at the the stages of S/W development life cycle
Build---->Ship--->Run



===========================================================================
Docker comes in 2 flavours
Docker CE (Community Edition)
Docker EE (Enterprise Edition)

Setup of Docker on Windows 
==============================
1 Download docker desktop from
  https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

2 Install it

3 Once docker is installed we can use Power shell
  to run the docker commands


========================================================================

Day 2
========================================================================
Install docker on Linux
==============================
1 Create an Ubuntu instance on AWS
2 Connect to it using git bash
3 Execute the below 2 commands
  curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
  sh get-docker.sh
 

Images and Containers
===========================
A Docker image is a combination of bin/libs that are necessary
for a s/w application to work.Initially all the s/w's of docker 
are available in the form of docker images

A running instance of an image is called as a container


Docker Host: The server where docker is installed is called
               docker host


==========================================================================
Docker Client:This is the CLI of docker where the user can execute the
docker commands,The docker client accepts these commands and passes them
to a background process called "docker deamon"

Docker deamon: This process accepts the commands coming from the docker client
and routes them to work on docker images or containers or the docker registry

Docker registry: This is the cloud site of docker where docker images are
stored.This is of two types
1 Public Registry( hub.docker.com)
2 Private Registry(Setup on one of our local servers)

========================================================================
Day 6
======================================================================
Docker compose
=======================
The disadvantage of "link" option is it is depricated and 
the same individual command have to be given multiple times
to setup similar architectures.
To avaoid this we can use docker compose
Docker compose uses yml files to setup the multu container 
architecture and these files can be resused any number of time
============================================================================
USeCase
==============

To check the running containers
docker container ls

To delete the containers
docker-compose down


============================================================================
Docker Volumes
====================
Containers are ephemeral(temporary) but the data processed by the
containers should be persistent.Once a container is delete all the 
data of the container is lost
To preserve the data even if the container is deleted we can use volumes

Volumes are classified into 3 types
======================================
1 Simple docker volume
2 Sharable dokcer volumes
3 Docker volume containers

Simple Docker volumes
===========================
These voluems are used only for preserving the data on the host
machine even if the containers is deleted

UsedCase
============
Create a directory /data and mount it as a volume on an ubuntu container
Create some files in the mounted volumes and check if the files
are preserved on the host machine even after the container is deleted

1 Create /data directory
  mkdir /data

2 Create an ubuntu container and mount the above directory as volume
  docker run --name u1 -it -v /data ubuntu
  In the container u1 go into /data directory and create some files
  cd /data
  touch file1 file2 file3
  exit

3 Identify the locatiuon where the mounted data is preserved
  docker inspect u1
  Search for "Mounts" section and copy the "Source" path

4 Delete the container
  docker rm -f u1

5 Check if the data is still present
  cd "source_path_from_step3"
  ls
======================================================================
Sharable Docker volumes
============================
These volumes are sharabale between multiple containers

Create 3 centos containers c1,c2,c3.
Mount /data as a volume on c1 container ,c2 should use the volume
used by c1 and c3 should use the volume used by c2

1 Create a centos container c1 and mount /data 
  docker run --name c2 -it -v /data centos

2 Go into the data folder create files in data folder
  cd data
  touch f1 f2

3  Come out of the container without exit
   ctlr+p,ctlr+q

4 Create another centos container c2 and it should used the voluems used by c1
  docker run --name c2 -it --volumes-from c1 centos
  
5 In the c2 container go into data folder and create some file
  cd data
  touch f3 f4

6 Come out of the container without exit
   ctlr+p,ctlr+q

7 Create another centos container c3 and it should use the volume used by c2
  docker run --name c3 -it --volumes-from c2 centos

8 In the c3 container go into data folder and create some file
  cd data
  touch f5 f6

9 Come out of the container without exit
   ctlr+p,ctlr+q

10 Go into any of the 3 contianers and we will see all the files
   docker attach c1
   cd /data
  ls
  exit

12 Identify the location the where the mounted data is stored
   docker inspect c1
   Search for "Mounts" section and copy the "Source" path

13 Delete all containers
   docker rm -f c1 c2 c3

14 Check if the files are still present
   cd "source_path_from"step12"


=======================================================================
Day 8
=======================================================================
=======================================================================
Docker volume containers
----------------------------
These volumes are bidirectoinal ie the changes done on host
will be reflected into container and changes done by container
will be reflected to host machine

1 Create a volume 
  docker volume create myvolume

2 To check the location where the mounted the volume works
  docker volume inspect myvolume

3 Copy the path shown in "MountPoint" and cd to that Path
  cd "MountPoint"

4 Create few files here
  touch file1 file2

5 Create a centos container and mount the above volume into the tmp folder
  docker run --name c1 -it -v myvolume:/tmp centos

6 Change to tmp folder and check for the files
  cd /tmp
  ls
  If we create any files here they will be reflected to host machine
  And these files will be present on the host even after deleting the 
  container.

===========================================================================
UseCase
============
Create a volume "newvolume" and create tomcat-users.xml file in it
Create a tomcat container and mount the above volume into it
Copy the tomcat-users.xml files to the required location

1 Create a volume
  docker volume create newvolume

2 Identify the mount location
  docker volume inspect newvolume
  Copy the "MountPoint" path

3 Move to this path
  cd "MountPoint path"

4 Create a file called tomcat-users.xml
  cat > tomcat-users.xml
  <tomcat-users>
      <user username="intelliqit" password="intelliqit" roles="manager-script"/>
  </tomcat-users>

5 Create a tomcat container and mount the above volume
  docker run --name webserver -d -P -v newvolume:/tmp tomcat

6 Go into bash shell of the tomcat container
  docker exec -it webserver bash

7 Move the tomcat-users.xml file into conf folder
  mv /tmp/tomcat-users.xml conf/

==================================================================
Creating customsied docker images
=========================================
This can be done in 2 ways
1 Using docker commit command
2 Using dockerfile

Using the docker commit command
====================================
UseCase
============
Create an ubuntu container and install some s/w's in it
Save this container as an image and later create a new container
from the newly created image.We will find all the s/w's that we 
installed.

1 Create an ubuntu container
  docker run --name u1 -it ubuntu

2 In the container update the apt repo and install s/w's
  apt-get update
  apt-get install -y git

3 Check if git is installed or not
  git --version
  exit

4 Save the customised container as an image
  docker commit u1 myubuntu

5 Check if the new image is created or not
  docker images

6 Delete the previousely create ubuntu container
  docker rm -f u1

7 Create an new container from the above created image 
  docker run --name u1 -it myubuntu

8 Check for git 
  git --version

=============================================================================
Dockerfile
===================
Dockerfile uses predefined keyword to create customsied
docker images.

Important keyword in dockerfile
===================================
FROM : This is used to specify the base image from where a
customised docker image has to be created

MAINTAINER : This represents the name of the organization or the
author that has created this dockerfile

RUN :Used to run linux commands in the container
     Generally it used to do s/w installtion or
     running scripts

USER : This is used to specify who should be the default user
       to login into the container

COPY : Used to copy files from host to the customised image that
       we are creating

ADD : This is similar to copy where it can copy files from host
      to image but ADD can also downlaod files from some remote server

EXPOSE : USed to specify what port should be used by the container

VOLUME : Used for automatic volume mounting ie we will have a volume
         mounted automatically when the container start

WORKDIR : Used to specify the default working directory of the container



ENV : This is used to specify what environment varibles should
     be used

CMD : USed to run the default process of the container from outside
      
ENTRYPOINT : This is also used to run the default process of the container
             
LABEL: Used to store data about the docker image in key value pairs

SHELL : Used to specify what shell should be by default used by the image

=================================================================================
Day 9
===============================================================================
UseCase
===========
Create a dockerfile to use nginx as abse image and specify
the maintainer as intelliqit

1 Create docker file
vim dockerfile

FROM nginx
MAINTAINER intelliqit

2 To create an image from this file
  docker build -t mynginx .

3 Check if the image is created or not
  docker images

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
UseCase
==============
Create a dockerfile from ubuntu base image and install 
git in it

1 Create dockerfile
  vim dockerfile
  FROM ubuntu
  MAINTAINER intelliqit
  RUN apt-get update
  RUN apt-get install -y git

2 Create an image from the above file
  docker build -t myubuntu .

3 Check if the new image is created
  docker images

4 Create a container from the new image and it should have git installed
  docker run  --name u1 -it myubuntu
  git --version



=========================================================
Cache Busting
===================
When we create an image from a dockerfile docker stores all the 
executed isntructions in a its cache.Next time if we edit the
same docker file and add few new instructions and build an image
out of it docker will not execute the previously executed statements
Instead it will read them from the cache
This is a time saving mechanism
The disadvantage is if the docker file is edited with a huge time
gap then we might end up installing s/w's that are outdated

Eg: 
FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y git

If we build an image from the above dockerfile docker saves all 
these instructions in the dockercache and if we add the below
statement
RUN apt-get install -y tree
only this latest statement will be excuted

To avoid this problem and make docker execute all the instructions 
once more time without reading from cache we use "cache busting"
docker build --no-cache -t myubuntu .

===============================================================




Download docker shll script into the docker host and copy it into the customsied docker image
and later install it at the time of creating the image

1 Download docker script
  curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh


2 Create the dockerfile
  vim dockerfile
  FROM ubuntu
  MAINTIANER intelliqit
  COPY get-docker.sh /
  RUN sh get-docker.sh

4 Create an image from the dockerfile
  docker build -t myubuntu .

5 Create a container from the above image
  docker run  --name u1 -it myubuntu

6 Check if the get-docker.sh is present in / and also see if docker is installed
  docker --version

============================================================================
Create a dockerfile from ubunt base image and downlaod jenkins.war
into it

1 Create a dockerfile
  vim dockerfile
  FROM ubuntu
  MAINTIANER intelliqit
  ADD https://get.jenkins.io/war-stable/2.263.4/jenkins.war  /

2 Create an image from the above dockerfile
  docker build -t myubuntu .

4 Create a container from this image
  docker run --name u1 -it myubuntu
 
5 Check if jenkins.war is present
  ls

=========================================================================================
